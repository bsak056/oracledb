switchover DG

Steps:

1. Verify if primary can be switched over to standby

SQL> select switchover_status from v$database;

If value returns “TO_STANDBY”, its alright to switch the primary to standby role.

2. Convert primary to standby

SQL> alter database commit to switchover to physical standby;

If value is “SESSIONS ACTIVE” from step 1, then

SQL> alter database commit to switchover to physical standby with session shutdown;

3. Shutdown & restart the old primary as standby

SQL> shutdown immediate;

SQL> startup nomount;

At this point, we now have both databases as standby.

4. On target standby database, verify switchover status. If value is “TO_PRIMARY” then

SQL> alter database commit to switchover to primary;

If value is “SESSIONS ACTIVE”, then append “WITH SESSION SHUTDOWN” to above command.

5. Shutdown and restart the new primary database

SQL> shutdown immediate;startup;

6. start recover on new standby database (old primary)

SQL > alter database mount standby database

SQL > alter database recover managed standby database using current logfile disconnect;
