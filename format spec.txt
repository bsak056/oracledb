format sp

Syntax Element	Description
%a

Specifies the activation ID of the database.

%b

Specifies the file name stripped of directory paths. It is only valid for SET NEWNAME and backup resetwhen producing image copies It yields errors if used as a format specification for a backup that produces backup pieces.

%c

Specifies the copy number of the backup piece within a set of duplexed backup pieces. If you did not duplex a backup, then this variable is 1 for backup sets and 0 for proxy copies. If a command is enabled, then the variable shows the copy number. The maximum value for %c is 256.

%d

Specifies the name of the database (see Example 4-23).

%D

Specifies the current day of the month from the Gregorian calendar in format DD.

%e

Specifies the archived log sequence number.

%f

Specifies the absolute file number (see Example 4-23).

%F

Combines the DBID, day, month, year, and sequence into a unique and repeatable generated name. This variable translates into c-IIIIIIIIII-YYYYMMDD-QQ, where:

IIIIIIIIII stands for the DBID. The DBID is printed in decimal so that it can be easily associated with the target database.

YYYYMMDD is a time stamp in the Gregorian calendar of the day the backup is generated

QQ is the sequence in hexadecimal number that starts with 00 and has a maximum of 'FF' (256)

Note: %F is valid only in the CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT command.

%h

Specifies the archived redo log thread number.

%I

Specifies the DBID.

%M

Specifies the month in the Gregorian calendar in format MM.

%N

Specifies the tablespace name. This substitution variable is only valid when backing up data files as image copies.

%n

Specifies the name of the database, padded on the right with x characters to a total length of eight characters. For example, if prod1 is the database name, then the padded name is prod1xxx.

%p

Specifies the piece number within the backup set. This value starts at 1 for each backup set and is incremented by 1 as each backup piece is created.

Note: If you specify PROXY, then the %p variable must be included in the FORMAT string either explicitly or implicitly within %U.

%r

Specifies the resetlogs ID.

%s

Specifies the backup set number. This number is a counter in the control file that is incremented for each backup set. The counter value starts at 1 and is unique for the lifetime of the control file. If you restore a backup control file, then duplicate values can result. Also, CREATE CONTROLFILE initializes the counter back to 1.

%t

Specifies the backup set time stamp, which is a 4-byte value derived as the number of seconds elapsed since a fixed reference time. You can use a combination of %s and %t to form a unique name for the backup set.

%T

Specifies the year, month, and day in the Gregorian calendar in this format: YYYYMMDD.

%u

Specifies an 8-character name constituted by compressed representations of the backup set or image copy number and the time the backup set or image copy was created.

%U

Specifies a system-generated unique file name (default).

The meaning of %U is different for image copies and backup pieces. For a backup piece, %U specifies a convenient shorthand for %u_%p_%c that guarantees uniqueness in generated backup file names. For an image copy of a data file, %U means the following:

data-D-%d_id-%I_TS-%N_FNO-%f_%u

For an image copy of an archived redo log, %U means the following:

arch-D_%d-id-%I_S-%e_T-%h_A-%a_%u

For an image copy of a control file, %U means the following:

cf-D_%d-id-%I_%u

%Y

Specifies the year in this format: YYYY.

%%

Specifies the percent (%) character. For example, %%Y translates to the string %Y.
